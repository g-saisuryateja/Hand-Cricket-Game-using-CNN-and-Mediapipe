# Hand-Cricket-Game-using-CNN-and-Mediapipe

This work involves implementing a
Hand Gesture based Hand Cricket Game, i.e., Once the player
starts playing by keeping his/her video, the hand gestures of the
player are recognized and the score of the player is calculated
until he gets out of the game or video. It is implemented in two
approaches i.e., first one using own dataset and custom-
developed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and another
using Mediapipe inbuilt model in Python Using OpenCV, Keras,
and MediaPipe Packages. The trained CNN gave an accuracy of
97.67 % and Mediapipeâ€™s hand tracking module has a precision
of 95.7%
